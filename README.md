# ProgrammaticallyCalculator_FC

  A calculator made programmatically with UIKit.
  
  I made this app to practice the AutoLayout techniques I learned in Jonathan Rasmusson's course. Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/level-up-in-auto-layout/
  
  Later I decided to add the functionality to the application.
  
  For those who are going to check, I am aware that the performance of the code I created is not the best possible, but I feel that it was a good experience to develop it.
 
  The appIcon has designed by ‘Anu Rocks’ https://freeicons.io/profile/730 .
